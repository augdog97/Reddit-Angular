 <!-- 
  1. Added a form that uses Semantic UI Framework for a responsive form.
  2. Added template variables to the input fields so click event function can use them.
      - Using the '#' creates local variables that we then pass as arguments into the function. 
      - Binding the title input to the #newtitle variable. #newtitle syntax is called a resolve. It allows the variable to be available to expressions within this view.
      - Template Variables are objects that represent input DOM elements in this case. This is why retreive the value of the variables with '(variablename).value'
  3. The Submit Button responds to a onclick event by running the addArticle function.
      - addArticle is a function on our component definition class AppComponent. 
      - newtitle comes from the resolve (#newtitle) on our input tag named title. 
      - newlink comes from the resolve (#newlink) on our input tag named link.
  4. Creating multiple article components using the ngFor directive. 
       - [inputName] = "inputValue". In this case we are saying to set the article input to the value of the local variable article set by ngfor.
